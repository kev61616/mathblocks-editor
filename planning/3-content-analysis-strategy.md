# MathBlocks Editor: Content Analysis Strategy

## Overview

The Content Analysis system is a core component of the MathBlocks Editor, responsible for intelligently analyzing static HTML math content and identifying opportunities for transformation into interactive blocks. This document outlines the strategy and techniques used to parse, analyze, and prepare HTML content for conversion.

## Analysis Components

### 1. HTML Structure Parser

**Purpose:** Analyze the document structure to understand content organization and semantic meanings.

**Techniques:**
- DOM traversal to create a hierarchical representation
- Semantic analysis of HTML elements (headings, sections, divs, etc.)
- Extraction of class and ID patterns that indicate content types
- Identification of content grouping patterns

**Outputs:**
- Document tree with semantic annotations
- Content section boundaries
- Heading hierarchy and relationship mapping

- Parameter extraction for configuration

**Output:**
- Recommended block type
- Required and optional parameters
- Content transformation plan
- Confidence score for recommendation

## Analysis Techniques

### Heuristic Rules

The system employs a set of heuristic rules to identify mathematical content types:

| Content Pattern | Recognition Rule | Block Type Mapping |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| y = mx + b format | `/y\s*=\s*([a-z])\s*x\s*[+\-]\s*([0-9]+)/` | Equation Explorer (Linear) |
| axÂ² + bx + c format | `/([a-z])\s*x\s*\^\s*2\s*[+\-]\s*([a-z])\s*x\s*[+\-]\s*([0-9]+)/` | Equation Explorer (Quadratic) |
| Step-by-step solution | Sequential numbered/bullet steps with calculations | Interactive Problem Solver |
| Data table with numerical values | `<table>` with primarily numeric cells | Mathematical Data Explorer |
| Multiple choice question | Question text followed by lettered/numbered options | Interactive Assessment |
| Geometric diagram with measurements | SVG/image with geometric shapes and measurement text | Concept Visualizer |

### Natural Language Processing

For text-heavy content, NLP techniques help identify mathematical concepts:

- **Keyword Extraction:** Identify mathematical terms and concepts
- **Intent Classification:** Determine educational purpose (instruction, example, practice)
- **Entity Recognition:** Extract mathematical entities (variables, equations, etc.)

### Visual Element Analysis

For graphical content:

- **Image Classification:** Identify charts, graphs, and diagrams
- **Structural Analysis:** Detect coordinate systems, function plots, etc.
- **Text-in-Image Extraction:** Capture equation text from images when possible

## Transformation Planning

### Transformation Suggestions Generation

After analysis, the system generates transformation suggestions including:

1. **Block Type Recommendation:** Primary and alternative block types
2. **Parameter Extraction:** Proposed configuration values from content
3. **Content Segmentation:** How to divide content for transformation
4. **Interactive Elements:** Recommended interactive controls
5. **Visualization Approach:** How to represent visual elements

### Confidence Scoring

Each suggestion includes confidence metrics:

- **Match Confidence:** How certain the system is about the pattern match
- **Transformation Complexity:** Estimated effort for transformation
- **Interactive Potential:** Estimated value of interactivity
- **Content Coverage:** How much of the original content is utilized

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Implement progressive analysis for large documents
- Use web workers for background processing
- Cache analysis results for repeated sections

### Extensibility

- Plugin architecture for custom detectors
- Configurable rule sets for different content types
- Trainable classification models for specific domains

### Accuracy Improvement

- User feedback integration to improve recommendations
- Pattern library expansion based on content repository
- Continuous training of classification models

## User Experience Integration

### Analysis Results Presentation

- Visual highlighting of transformation opportunities in content
- Side-by-side preview of original vs. transformed content
- Confidence indicators for recommendations
- Interactive selection of elements for transformation

### User Guidance

- Transformation wizards for complex content
